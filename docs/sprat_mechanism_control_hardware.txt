Mechanisms
----------

- mirror in/out
- slit in/out
- grism in/out
- grism rotate

Therefore 4 relays to control 12v pneumatic actuators (solenoids).
Output from Arduino is 5v, therefore 5v->12v relays x 4
SDB says: 0.4W per solenoid (0.03A?)


Plus tungsten on/off relay - 12v output
therefore 5v->12v relays x 5

Mains power switching relay also required to turn on and off arc lamp:
1 x 5v->mains relay (spare?)

6 relays total (4xsolenoid, 1xtungsten, 1xarc lamp)
Relays are SY5120-6DOSD-0
1F-Q
Seem to have resistance of around 390 ohm
This agrees with 30mA being pulled at 12v :- 0.36W

Reed/micro switches not needed, we have some for test in-house. There will be 8 inputs eventually.
These are SMC D-C80 reed switches. See SMC_D-Auto_Switches.pdf P10 (16-6-9).

Power supplies needed:
5v for Arduino
12v for pneumatic solenoids and tungsten lamp
Arc lamp mains power supply - we already have one of these on the telescope
Andor camera PSU
Uniblitz PSU 36v/1.83A
USB Extender (for Andor USB camera control) PSU. Mains power supply block with 5v output, use our own 5v supply?

Power supplies

These as ordered for IO:I:

http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/din-rail-panel-mount-power-supplies/0428427/

http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/din-rail-panel-mount-power-supplies/0428449/
MDR-20-5 MINI DIN RAIL,5V 3A

Is the 12v one too weedy for the tungsten lamp? How about:

10-15v PSU
http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/din-rail-panel-mount-power-supplies/7923168/
DIN Rail Power Supply 230/12-4
RS Stock No. 792-3168 
This is the current best guess. However it is only 4amp.
The latest power spreadsheet says we need:
Tungsten lamp (unknown , but Zej says assume 1A)
Tung Lamp relay 12vx0.03A
Arc Lamp relay 12vx0.03A
Mirror pneumatic valve 12vx0.04A
Grism pneumatic valve 12vx0.04A
Rotate grism pneumatic valve 12vx0.04A
We are missing relay board/relay power requirements (for the pneumatic side at least)
Also slit in/out pneumatic valve (presumably 12vx0.04A)

Therefore now 4A is plenty? Estimated 1.85A @ 13v

Arduino DIN rail mount
----------------------

Arduino PCB 98.5/101mm x 53mm excluding ethernet/power/USB connectors. 105mm x 53mm with ethernet connector.
Height ~18mm, 20mm for clearance.
Allow 50mm for Ethernet cable + bend radius :- USB connector is smaller. Power connector is roughly same size.
Therefore box required is ~101mm x 53mm if we drill holes in the end for the connectors.
Otherwise ~150mm x 53mm if the cables end up still in the box.

We house the relay board in the same enclosure:- Board Size: 14cm x 5.5cm Height ~18mm - 20mm for clearance.
Both Arduino and relay board will fit in the 'B' space envelope, and 
The combination will NOT fit in the A+B envelope vertically. 
A+B vertically = 26.5+21.5 -10.8 =  37.2 or 30.1+7.6 = 37.7, but we need 40mm
